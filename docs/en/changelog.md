## Upgrade Notes

### Upgrading to 0.2.0 (Future)

When 0.2.0 is released with credential encryption:

1. **Backup your database** before upgrading
2. Existing credentials will be migrated automatically
3. If migration fails, re-import accounts from JSON backup

### Database Migrations

Database migrations run automatically on application startup. No manual intervention required.

**Note**: Migrations cannot be rolled back. Always backup before upgrading.
